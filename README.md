# ANOTHER CALCULATOR APP

### Inspiration

This calculator is modeled after the **Braun ET66** - the calculator that design dorks love. Originally designed by Dieter Rams, this calculator does NOT guarantee the same degree of perfection.

### Notes

I had made a calculator app before, with really clumsy calculation logic. By structuring operations into an object, the code is REALLY cleaned up.

## Needs

- Button Grid could be refactored for less repitition.
- Needs more layout work.
- Testing of component/button logic
